Patient was assigned to our floor by bed board. After reviewing patient's chart I noted that patient had CT that showed ICH with blood in bilateral posterior ventricles, but had no neuro checks or stroke scales ordered. I called bed board to question the fact that patient had no neuro orders and was told that since they were not ordered it was obvious that the physicians did not want them. I voiced that I was not comfortable taking this patient without getting clarification from patient's admitting provider. I paged the admitting physicians pager, but the provider that I spoke with was not the admitting provider. When I questioned if the patient needed neuro checks or stroke scale I was advised that the admitting provider must not have wanted neuro checks or stroke scales done since they were not ordered. I clarified with the provider that he was okay with us having a patient on 4B with an ICH and no neuro checks or stroke scales being done and his answer was yes. After I hung with the physician I then received a call from the Nursing Coordinator who advised me that she needed me to take the patient. I again voiced my concern that we were not doing neuro checks or stroke scales on this patient, and she advised me that the bleed was mild and that neurosurgery had signed off on the patient and that the only reason the patient was being admitted was because he was in a fib with RVR. This was not true. I read neurosurgery note and it advised that they would watch the patient closely, repeat a CT of the head, and monitor patient's neuro exams very closely for any change. The patient was eventually assigned to our floor and after the patient arrived the primary RN was able to speak with the admitting physician who stated he ""absolutely wanted us to do neuro checks."" He asked the primary RN initially if we could do every 2 hour neuro checks and she advised him that on our floor we can only do every 4 hour neuro checks and he stated he was okay with that unless something changes with patient.

Primary RN had to leave shift mid-morning so unit's float RN was given handoff report to take over pt assignment. During report, Primary RN informed float RN that pt, who was currently in dialysis, had orders for 2units PRBCs (ordered previous day at 0512) that had yet to be administered (over 24hrs later). Primary RN informed float RN that it was because pt had rare antibodies and units were not ready yet. At completion of report, float RN called blood bank and was informed by blood bank that both units were ready and had been ready since 0651 the previous morning ([DATE]). Less than two hours after prepare and transfuse order was entered by MD. Float RN was then called by dialysis to inform that pt was being transported back to room. At this time, float RN was contacted by hematology team as pt was supposed to have a bone marrow biopsy completed at 1230. Hematology informed by float RN that pt had yet to receive blood products. Hematology informed float RN that they would not be able to complete scheduled procedure if blood products were infusing and as pt was to get two units ordered at slow rate it would take approximately 6-7hrs to complete both units if hung immediately making it so biopsy most likely would not get completed today as desired. Primary team contacted by float RN requesting if units could be delayed until after biopsy at 1230 so that procedure would not get postponed further. Primary MD informed float RN that pt already had had units delayed as he had told previous dayshift RN that units could be given the next day in dialysis as that would be easier for pt. (MDs plan for this was also included in previous days progress note.) MD gave permission to delay transfusion again until after biopsy. Hematology made aware and biopsy completed and first unit hung by float RN. Float RN was then informed by charge RN that while in morning discharge rounds, primary RN had been contacted by dialysis over vocera asking if ordered two units of blood were to be given by them and primary RN informed dialysis that units of blood would be administered once pt got back to room on floor.

She then stated that she works for IIG and she was ""just taking a break"". I questioned her further and she stated several times that she worked for IIG, was on the payroll, and was working today. After asking her about the safety of working construction in the flip flops she was wearing, she stated that she had just taken off her boots because her toe hurt. This was not true as I had seen her in flip flops that morning. I again told her to leave and she stated, ""then I will find something to do"" and walked to the construction area. I called and asked security to speak with me so that together we could have her leave the building. When security and I both arrived in the construction area, we asked to speak to a supervisor and a male who stated he is the supervisor told us that the female does work for IIG, is on the payroll, and is working today. I asked what type of work she did for them and he said ""she does our paperwork"". Security and I went to look for her again but could not locate her. I went back to speak with the supervisor, but this time when I approached him and asked him ""you are the supervisor, right?"" he looked around at his coworkers and said ""no"". I asked to see his badge and he stated he didn't have one. I asked to speak to the highest supervisor and was told it was [PERSONALNAME]. [PERSONALNAME] stated that he was the foreman. I advised him I was about to ask him some questions and he needed to be truthful. He admitted that ""[PERSONALNAME]"", the lady wearing flip flops does not work for IIG, is his wife, and is in the hospital waiting on him while he works. I advised him she was to leave and not return. He stated she had already left. As security and I exited the construction area, security saw [PERSONALNAME] walking out the door below us. Security and the IIG foreman, [PERSONALNAME], were advised that [PERSONALNAME] was not to return. I called the facilities engineering manager, [PERSONALNAME], to report this incident. He contacted [PERSONALNAME], the supervisor for CSP. [PERSONALNAME] stated he had spoken to the owner of the company, and it had been handled. ..

The patient was brought emergently to the cath lab as a code STEMI by RCEMS. Patient was alert and oriented x3 and gave good history from recent admission to [PERSONALNAME] in which she was also a code STEMI. Patient had discharge paperwork from said admission. At [PERSONALNAME], patient received stent to her LAD for STEMI and concurrently developed a ""cold leg"" post cath intervention, which resulted in some form of surgical intervention. Patient was discharged [DATE]. When asked, the patient stated she didn't take her antiplatelet meds because she couldn't afford them. The patient still had surgical staples in her right groin, so left groin was prepped. The patient stated before the procedure she had no chest pain. The patient was draped and arterial access was gained with no complication. Angiography performed on the left coronary system confirmed our suspicion of stent thrombosis, the stented LAD was occluded proximally. The vessel was wired with no complication, but the patient became anxious and agitated after balloon reperfusion. Angiography showed TIMI 2 flow through the LAD with possible clot in the LM and an aspiration catheter was inserted. The patient had difficulty breathing, so anesthesia and respiratory were paged to intubate emergently. CCU RNs were called for additional help. The patient became increasingly hypotensive and received 3 defibrillations for VF. CPR and ACLS protocols were initiated. This continued for around 45 minutes to no avail. The patient expired at 19:52 pm.

His girlfriend let me know that his father was not aware that he was having surgery.

The patient's daughter was not there and had left (unbeknownst to the patient) in another car earlier in the evening due to a family emergency. Patient could not get in contact with anyone else to get a ride home. Mobile care was called for transport as the patient met the specialized isolation/infection control parameters that would qualify her for their services. The patient was agreeable to Mobile Care Transport. The patient was brought back to her original room. Mobile Care arrived to receive patient and asked why they were having to transport an able bodied patient home. I explained to them that she had received multiple doses of narcotic pain medication, anti emetics, and benadryl so she shouldn't be driving herself home and that the patient had tried to contact her ride multiple times and that, along with being possible altered from the medications she received, I did not feel like it was safe for her to call another ride and expose them to covid. Mobile Care loaded the patient up into their ambulance and (to our immediate knowledge) left to transport the patient home. About twenty minutes after the patient's departure, an American Security employee came back to the ED and informed me that the Mobile Care crew had driven to the front of the hospital and that the patient got out, got in her car, and drove home.

Patient was assigned to our floor by bed board. After reviewing patient's chart I noted that patient had CT that showed ICH with blood in bilateral posterior ventricles, but had no neuro checks or stroke scales ordered. I called bed board to question the fact that patient had no neuro orders and was told that since they were not ordered it was obvious that the physicians did not want them. I voiced that I was not comfortable taking this patient without getting clarification from patient's admitting provider. I paged the admitting physicians pager, but the provider that I spoke with was not the admitting provider. When I questioned if the patient needed neuro checks or stroke scale I was advised that the admitting provider must not have wanted neuro checks or stroke scales done since they were not ordered. I clarified with the provider that he was okay with us having a patient on 4B with an ICH and no neuro checks or stroke scales being done and his answer was yes. After I hung with the physician I then received a call from the Nursing Coordinator who advised me that she needed me to take the patient. I again voiced my concern that we were not doing neuro checks or stroke scales on this patient, and she advised me that the bleed was mild and that neurosurgery had signed off on the patient and that the only reason the patient was being admitted was because he was in a fib with RVR. This was not true. I read neurosurgery note and it advised that they would watch the patient closely, repeat a CT of the head, and monitor patient's neuro exams very closely for any change. The patient was eventually assigned to our floor and after the patient arrived the primary RN was able to speak with the admitting physician who stated he ""absolutely wanted us to do neuro checks."" He asked the primary RN initially if we could do every 2 hour neuro checks and she advised him that on our floor we can only do every 4 hour neuro checks and he stated he was okay with that unless something changes with patient.

Primary RN had to leave shift mid-morning so unit's float RN was given handoff report to take over pt assignment. During report, Primary RN informed float RN that pt, who was currently in dialysis, had orders for 2units PRBCs (ordered previous day at 0512) that had yet to be administered (over 24hrs later). Primary RN informed float RN that it was because pt had rare antibodies and units were not ready yet. At completion of report, float RN called blood bank and was informed by blood bank that both units were ready and had been ready since 0651 the previous morning ([DATE]). Less than two hours after prepare and transfuse order was entered by MD. Float RN was then called by dialysis to inform that pt was being transported back to room. At this time, float RN was contacted by hematology team as pt was supposed to have a bone marrow biopsy completed at 1230. Hematology informed by float RN that pt had yet to receive blood products. Hematology informed float RN that they would not be able to complete scheduled procedure if blood products were infusing and as pt was to get two units ordered at slow rate it would take approximately 6-7hrs to complete both units if hung immediately making it so biopsy most likely would not get completed today as desired. Primary team contacted by float RN requesting if units could be delayed until after biopsy at 1230 so that procedure would not get postponed further. Primary MD informed float RN that pt already had had units delayed as he had told previous dayshift RN that units could be given the next day in dialysis as that would be easier for pt. (MDs plan for this was also included in previous days progress note.) MD gave permission to delay transfusion again until after biopsy. Hematology made aware and biopsy completed and first unit hung by float RN. Float RN was then informed by charge RN that while in morning discharge rounds, primary RN had been contacted by dialysis over vocera asking if ordered two units of blood were to be given by them and primary RN informed dialysis that units of blood would be administered once pt got back to room on floor.

[[DATE]:[DATE]:[DATE] the reporter] This morning a female approached the 2nd floor desk and asked if we had a gift shop. I told her we did but it was closed due to covid. I asked if I could help her and she stated she was waiting on her husband and was bored. We chatted for a few minutes and she walked away. I assumed she meant she was waiting on her husband to be discharged from the 2nd floor since that is where we were located and we were currently working on discharging patients. However, after the patients on the 2nd floor had all been discharged (except one female patient who was moved to the 3rd floor) I saw the female visitor again, sitting in a chair near the employee/patient elevators on the 2nd floor. After questioning her I learned that she was actually waiting on her husband who is a construction worker for the company IIG. I told her the construction workers, or any employees in the hospital could not have visitors and she would have to leave. She argued with me, stating things like she didn't have a vehicle, she didn't have anywhere to go, she didn't know the area, he wasn't getting off work until late, etc. and I told her she would still have to leave the building but she could stay in the parking lot, and that we have benches and covered areas. She then stated that she works for IIG and she was ""just taking a break"". I questioned her further and she stated several times that she worked for IIG, was on the payroll, and was working today. After asking her about the safety of working construction in the flip flops she was wearing, she stated that she had just taken off her boots because her toe hurt. This was not true as I had seen her in flip flops that morning. I again told her to leave and she stated, ""then I will find something to do"" and walked to the construction area. I called and asked security to speak with me so that together we could have her leave the building. When security and I both arrived in the construction area, we asked to speak to a supervisor and a male who stated he is the supervisor told us that the female does work for IIG, is on the payroll, and is working today. I asked what type of work she did for them and he said ""she does our paperwork"". Security and I went to look for her again but could not locate her. I went back to speak with the supervisor, but this time when I approached him and asked him ""you are the supervisor, right?"" he looked around at his coworkers and said ""no"". I asked to see his badge and he stated he didn't have one. I asked to speak to the highest supervisor and was told it was [PERSONALNAME]. [PERSONALNAME] stated that he was the foreman. I advised him I was about to ask him some questions and he needed to be truthful. He admitted that ""[PERSONALNAME]"", the lady wearing flip flops does not work for IIG, is his wife, and is in the hospital waiting on him while he works. I advised him she was to leave and not return. He stated she had already left. As security and I exited the construction area, security saw [PERSONALNAME] walking out the door below us. Security and the IIG foreman, [PERSONALNAME], were advised that [PERSONALNAME] was not to return. I called the facilities engineering manager, [PERSONALNAME], to report this incident. He contacted [PERSONALNAME], the supervisor for CSP. [PERSONALNAME] stated he had spoken to the owner of the company, and it had been handled. ..

The patient was brought emergently to the cath lab as a code STEMI by RCEMS. Patient was alert and oriented x3 and gave good history from recent admission to [PERSONALNAME] in which she was also a code STEMI. Patient had discharge paperwork from said admission. At [PERSONALNAME], patient received stent to her LAD for STEMI and concurrently developed a ""cold leg"" post cath intervention, which resulted in some form of surgical intervention. Patient was discharged [DATE]. When asked, the patient stated she didn't take her antiplatelet meds because she couldn't afford them. The patient still had surgical staples in her right groin, so left groin was prepped. The patient stated before the procedure she had no chest pain. The patient was draped and arterial access was gained with no complication. Angiography performed on the left coronary system confirmed our suspicion of stent thrombosis, the stented LAD was occluded proximally. The vessel was wired with no complication, but the patient became anxious and agitated after balloon reperfusion. Angiography showed TIMI 2 flow through the LAD with possible clot in the LM and an aspiration catheter was inserted. The patient had difficulty breathing, so anesthesia and respiratory were paged to intubate emergently. CCU RNs were called for additional help. The patient became increasingly hypotensive and received 3 defibrillations for VF. CPR and ACLS protocols were initiated. This continued for around 45 minutes to no avail. The patient expired at 19:52 pm.

I called the girlfriend at the number provided in his chart to see if his next-of-kin (father) was aware of his surgery before calling and asking his father for possible consent. His girlfriend let me know that his father was not aware that he was having surgery. We did not want to divulge information to his contact who was not aware of his procedure, so my manager consulted her supervisor who then consulted legal. Discussion was made between the surgeon and supervising staff and the decision was made to wake the patient up and cancel the case due to not having surgical consent signed by the patient.

Orders received for patient to use 2L of oxygen overnight or to use his own CPAP machine.

The patient's daughter was not there and had left (unbeknownst to the patient) in another car earlier in the evening due to a family emergency. Patient could not get in contact with anyone else to get a ride home. Mobile care was called for transport as the patient met the specialized isolation/infection control parameters that would qualify her for their services. The patient was agreeable to Mobile Care Transport. The patient was brought back to her original room. Mobile Care arrived to receive patient and asked why they were having to transport an able bodied patient home. I explained to them that she had received multiple doses of narcotic pain medication, anti emetics, and benadryl so she shouldn't be driving herself home and that the patient had tried to contact her ride multiple times and that, along with being possible altered from the medications she received, I did not feel like it was safe for her to call another ride and expose them to covid. Mobile Care loaded the patient up into their ambulance and (to our immediate knowledge) left to transport the patient home.

Patient was assigned to our floor by bed board. After reviewing patient's chart I noted that patient had CT that showed ICH with blood in bilateral posterior ventricles, but had no neuro checks or stroke scales ordered. I called bed board to question the fact that patient had no neuro orders and was told that since they were not ordered it was obvious that the physicians did not want them. I voiced that I was not comfortable taking this patient without getting clarification from patient's admitting provider. I paged the admitting physicians pager, but the provider that I spoke with was not the admitting provider. When I questioned if the patient needed neuro checks or stroke scale I was advised that the admitting provider must not have wanted neuro checks or stroke scales done since they were not ordered. I clarified with the provider that he was okay with us having a patient on 4B with an ICH and no neuro checks or stroke scales being done and his answer was yes. After I hung with the physician I then received a call from the Nursing Coordinator who advised me that she needed me to take the patient. I again voiced my concern that we were not doing neuro checks or stroke scales on this patient, and she advised me that the bleed was mild and that neurosurgery had signed off on the patient and that the only reason the patient was being admitted was because he was in a fib with RVR. This was not true. I read neurosurgery note and it advised that they would watch the patient closely, repeat a CT of the head, and monitor patient's neuro exams very closely for any change. The patient was eventually assigned to our floor and after the patient arrived the primary RN was able to speak with the admitting physician who stated he ""absolutely wanted us to do neuro checks."" He asked the primary RN initially if we could do every 2 hour neuro checks and she advised him that on our floor we can only do every 4 hour neuro checks and he stated he was okay with that unless something changes with patient.

Primary RN had to leave shift mid-morning so unit's float RN was given handoff report to take over pt assignment. During report, Primary RN informed float RN that pt, who was currently in dialysis, had orders for 2units PRBCs (ordered previous day at 0512) that had yet to be administered (over 24hrs later). Primary RN informed float RN that it was because pt had rare antibodies and units were not ready yet. At completion of report, float RN called blood bank and was informed by blood bank that both units were ready and had been ready since 0651 the previous morning ([DATE]). Less than two hours after prepare and transfuse order was entered by MD. Float RN was then called by dialysis to inform that pt was being transported back to room. At this time, float RN was contacted by hematology team as pt was supposed to have a bone marrow biopsy completed at 1230. Hematology informed by float RN that pt had yet to receive blood products. Hematology informed float RN that they would not be able to complete scheduled procedure if blood products were infusing and as pt was to get two units ordered at slow rate it would take approximately 6-7hrs to complete both units if hung immediately making it so biopsy most likely would not get completed today as desired. Primary team contacted by float RN requesting if units could be delayed until after biopsy at 1230 so that procedure would not get postponed further. Primary MD informed float RN that pt already had had units delayed as he had told previous dayshift RN that units could be given the next day in dialysis as that would be easier for pt. (MDs plan for this was also included in previous days progress note.) MD gave permission to delay transfusion again until after biopsy. Hematology made aware and biopsy completed and first unit hung by float RN. Float RN was then informed by charge RN that while in morning discharge rounds, primary RN had been contacted by dialysis over vocera asking if ordered two units of blood were to be given by them and primary RN informed dialysis that units of blood would be administered once pt got back to room on floor.

We had a patient come to xray for a Barium Enema. The chart had no isolation noted. After the Techs moved the patient, and started giving the diagnosis to the radiologist, the radiologist communicated to us that he saw the patient had a history of enterococcus faecalis infection and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. My Manager tried 3 times for infection control to call back regarding this patient to see if this patient was still under contact precautions. We were not gowned at first but then treated it as contact and wiped everything with bleach just in case.

At approximately 0930, the charge nurse from labor and delivery called the desk and asked for a scrub tech because her only scrub tech was involved in a case. I told her that I did not have a free scrub to send and she stated that the case was an emergency. I explained to her that I would talk to the nurse managers to see if they could help find a scrub for the case. She then stated that she would have to do the case in the main OR. I told her that I would have to pull a scrub from a room, which would leave one of my rooms short a scrub tech. She stated that she needed the person now because it was an emergency.

[[DATE]:[DATE]:[DATE] the reporter] This morning a female approached the 2nd floor desk and asked if we had a gift shop. I told her we did but it was closed due to covid. I asked if I could help her and she stated she was waiting on her husband and was bored. We chatted for a few minutes and she walked away. I assumed she meant she was waiting on her husband to be discharged from the 2nd floor since that is where we were located and we were currently working on discharging patients. However, after the patients on the 2nd floor had all been discharged (except one female patient who was moved to the 3rd floor) I saw the female visitor again, sitting in a chair near the employee/patient elevators on the 2nd floor. After questioning her I learned that she was actually waiting on her husband who is a construction worker for the company IIG. I told her the construction workers, or any employees in the hospital could not have visitors and she would have to leave. She argued with me, stating things like she didn't have a vehicle, she didn't have anywhere to go, she didn't know the area, he wasn't getting off work until late, etc. and I told her she would still have to leave the building but she could stay in the parking lot, and that we have benches and covered areas. She then stated that she works for IIG and she was ""just taking a break"". I questioned her further and she stated several times that she worked for IIG, was on the payroll, and was working today. After asking her about the safety of working construction in the flip flops she was wearing, she stated that she had just taken off her boots because her toe hurt. This was not true as I had seen her in flip flops that morning. I again told her to leave and she stated, ""then I will find something to do"" and walked to the construction area. I called and asked security to speak with me so that together we could have her leave the building. When security and I both arrived in the construction area, we asked to speak to a supervisor and a male who stated he is the supervisor told us that the female does work for IIG, is on the payroll, and is working today. I asked what type of work she did for them and he said ""she does our paperwork"". Security and I went to look for her again but could not locate her. I went back to speak with the supervisor, but this time when I approached him and asked him ""you are the supervisor, right?"" he looked around at his coworkers and said ""no"". I asked to see his badge and he stated he didn't have one. I asked to speak to the highest supervisor and was told it was [PERSONALNAME]. [PERSONALNAME] stated that he was the foreman. I advised him I was about to ask him some questions and he needed to be truthful. He admitted that ""[PERSONALNAME]"", the lady wearing flip flops does not work for IIG, is his wife, and is in the hospital waiting on him while he works. I advised him she was to leave and not return. He stated she had already left. As security and I exited the construction area, security saw [PERSONALNAME] walking out the door below us. Security and the IIG foreman, [PERSONALNAME], were advised that [PERSONALNAME] was not to return. I called the facilities engineering manager, [PERSONALNAME], to report this incident.

The patient was brought emergently to the cath lab as a code STEMI by RCEMS. Patient was alert and oriented x3 and gave good history from recent admission to [PERSONALNAME] in which she was also a code STEMI. Patient had discharge paperwork from said admission. At [PERSONALNAME], patient received stent to her LAD for STEMI and concurrently developed a ""cold leg"" post cath intervention, which resulted in some form of surgical intervention. Patient was discharged [DATE]. When asked, the patient stated she didn't take her antiplatelet meds because she couldn't afford them. The patient still had surgical staples in her right groin, so left groin was prepped. The patient stated before the procedure she had no chest pain. The patient was draped and arterial access was gained with no complication. Angiography performed on the left coronary system confirmed our suspicion of stent thrombosis, the stented LAD was occluded proximally. The vessel was wired with no complication, but the patient became anxious and agitated after balloon reperfusion. Angiography showed TIMI 2 flow through the LAD with possible clot in the LM and an aspiration catheter was inserted. The patient had difficulty breathing, so anesthesia and respiratory were paged to intubate emergently. CCU RNs were called for additional help. The patient became increasingly hypotensive and received 3 defibrillations for VF. CPR and ACLS protocols were initiated. This continued for around 45 minutes to no avail. The patient expired at 19:52 pm.

I called the girlfriend at the number provided in his chart to see if his next-of-kin (father) was aware of his surgery before calling and asking his father for possible consent. His girlfriend let me know that his father was not aware that he was having surgery. We did not want to divulge information to his contact who was not aware of his procedure, so my manager consulted her supervisor who then consulted legal. Discussion was made between the surgeon and supervising staff and the decision was made to wake the patient up and cancel the case due to not having surgical consent signed by the patient.

Orders received for patient to use 2L of oxygen overnight or to use his own CPAP machine. Patient declined oxygen because his mouth stays open when he sleeps and that is what obstructs his airway so the oxygen would not help him.

If patient did not have his own CPAP machine he could obstructed his airway and would be more at risk for post operative pneumonia.

Mobile Care arrived to receive patient and asked why they were having to transport an able bodied patient home. I explained to them that she had received multiple doses of narcotic pain medication, anti emetics, and benadryl so she shouldn't be driving herself home and that the patient had tried to contact her ride multiple times and that, along with being possible altered from the medications she received, I did not feel like it was safe for her to call another ride and expose them to covid.

[[DATE]:[DATE]:43 the reporter] Infection Prevention was contacted at 1130 by MICU questioning isolation precautions for a COVID19 patient. The charge nurse on MICU was told in report from the primary nurse on 11E that patient's Specialized Isolation precautions were removed. The orders were still in the computer so the MICU nurse did not feel the proper channels were followed to DC precautions and she called IP to verify. The IP nurse called the epidemiologist as the patient was 11 days from positive test, patient had to be placed on high flow O2, was hypothermic and had AMS which prompted the Rapid Response at 0930 and increase in level of care. The epidemiologist stated the patient should still be on isolation precautions. The patient was immediately placed on specialized isolation however there was an exposure risk on 11E, CT, and MICU due to the discontinuation. The nurse's transferring the patient and the CT tech wore face mask but no eye protection and patient was not masked. ..

Radiologist was ok to go ahead and scan. The patient was ok so far. He was ok during the exam. Because he was a COVID pending patient my coworker went in and after it was done she told me that he's getting itchy, but not too bad.
