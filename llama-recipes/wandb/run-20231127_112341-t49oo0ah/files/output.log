A: Can you go with me to the animal shelter?.
B: What do you want to do?
A: I want to get a puppy for my son.
B: That will make him so happy.
A: Yeah, weâ€™ve discussed it many times. I think heâ€™s ready now.
B: Thatâ€™s good. Raising a dog is a tough issue. Like having a baby ;-)
A: I'll get him one of those little dogs.
B: One that won't grow up too big;-)
A: And eat too much;-))
B: Do you know which one he would like?
A: Oh, yes, I took him there last Monday. He showed me one that he really liked.
B: I bet you had to drag him away.
A: He wanted to take it home right away ;-).
B: I wonder what he'll name it.
A: He said heâ€™d name it after his dead hamster â€“ Lemmy  - he's  a great Motorhead fan :-)))
